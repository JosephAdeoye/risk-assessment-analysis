# Risk Assessment Analysis

Here is a little background story of the company we would be conducting our risk assessment on as provided by **PwC**;

*Boldi AG is a family-owned business in Switzerland with around 90 employees. They are a premium component supplier for the chemical industry, they have 4 people in IT and hire external IT consultants now and then.*

*Last night the news had a story about a competitor who was hit by a severe ransomware attack. A wake-up call for Boldi AG: their last information risk analysis was conducted in 2014. Management has decided to ask top consultancies to pitch their cybersecurity services. You are working with your project lead on location at Boldi to learn as much as possible about the company. First, it is critical to establish a common understanding of information risk at Boldi AG. This means learning about the company and its culture.*

- What is their risk tolerance?

- How willing are they to accept risk?

- How do they handle changes in processes and systems?

## Here is the task

1. To learn more about Boldi AG and its culture, you first need to determine who you should talk to at Boldi AG and what the content of these interviews should be. How does your agenda differ based on the audience, e.g. management vs. engineers? Stefan is currently in a meeting, leave him a voicemail (no longer than 1.5 minutes).

2. Now you are prepared to conduct an information risk impact assessment. In the meantime, you discover that Boldi AG files on paper and the company’s cloud-based information systems are inconsistent in format and hard to use for analysis. Plus, there are no controls over who in the company can access these files. 

Does any of this present an information security concern? Please explain your answer in the slide deck. Think of this through the prism of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), and add slides to your started presentation.

3. After you know enough about Boldi AG, decide what type of risk assessment would be best, a quantitative risk assessment or a qualitative risk assessment. Then explain the difference between quantitative and qualitative assessments. What do you rely on to be able to perform a quantitative assessment? Which method could be more adapted for information security risk assessments? 

# Below Is How I Carried Out Each Task
## Task 1

This task requires me to leave a voicemail for my project manager, Stefan, detailing whom I would need to talk to at Boldi AG, as well as what the content of the interviews should be to determine the company’s culture. And also how the agenda differs based on the audience (managers vs. engineers). So, below is a voicemail I would drop for Stefan that explains how I would go about this:
